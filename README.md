## Cheat Sheet
**Port 139**: SMB originally ran on top of **NetBIOS** using port 139. NetBIOS is an older transport layer that allows Windows computers to talk to each other on the same network.


Port 445: Later versions of SMB (after Windows 2000) began to use port 445 on top of a TCP stack. Using TCP allows SMB to work over the internet.
